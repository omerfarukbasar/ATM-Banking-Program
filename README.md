# ATM Program
This repository contains some of the course work that I have worked on during my spring 2020 semester of intermediate programming.

All of these files were done as individual labs that would eventually be completeted as a final project.

I have written most of the code, although there are some files that were provided by the professor such as SortsClass.java
as well as all of the IOHandler files

Please note that this was only my second programming class, so my coding techniques and organization may not be as good as
what I am currently capabale of as of today.
